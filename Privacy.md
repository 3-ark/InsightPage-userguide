**Privacy Policy for InsightPage**

*Last Updated: [July 1st 2025]*

Thank you for using InsightPage ("the Extension"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your data is handled when you use our extension.

### 1. No Personal Data Collection by the Extension

InsightPage is designed with your privacy as a priority. The extension **does not** collect, store, or transmit any of your personal information, browsing history, or conversation logs. All your settings and data handled directly by the extension remain on your local device.

### 2. Data Processing and User Choice

The core functionality of InsightPage involves processing your input (such as chat messages or queries) to provide AI-powered responses. You have complete control over how your data is processed by choosing from two types of AI models:

#### a) Local (On-Device) Models

If you select a local AI model, all processing occurs **entirely on your computer**. Your data, including your inputs and the model's responses, **is never sent to any external servers or third parties**. This option offers the highest level of privacy.

#### b) Third-Party Cloud-Based AI Providers

You can configure the extension to connect to various third-party cloud-based AI providers. This includes both pre-configured services (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini) and any **custom API endpoint** you choose to add. When you use any of these third-party services, the content you provide will be sent to that provider's servers to generate a response.

*   **Data Sent:** Only the content required to fulfill your request (e.g., the text of your message, retrieved notes and conversation history for context) is sent to the provider you select.
*   **Your Consent:** Data is only sent to a third-party provider when you explicitly select that provider (or a custom endpoint) and use it within the extension.
*   **Third-Party Privacy Policies:** Your use of these services is subject to their respective privacy policies and terms of service. We do not control how these providers handle your data.
*   **Your Responsibility:** It is **your responsibility** to review the privacy policy of any third-party service you choose to use, especially for custom endpoints you configure yourself. We strongly encourage you to understand their data practices before sending them any data.

For your convenience, here are links to the privacy policies for some of the popular, pre-configured services you can use:
*   **OpenAI:** `[https://openai.com/policies/row-privacy-policy/]`
*   **Google (Gemini):** `[https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms]`
*   **OpenRouter:** `[https://openrouter.ai/privacy]`

When you add a custom API endpoint, we cannot provide a link to its privacy policy. Please ensure you trust the provider and have reviewed their policies before use.
